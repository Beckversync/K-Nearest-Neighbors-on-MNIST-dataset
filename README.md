# 🧠 K-Nearest Neighbors on MNIST Dataset  

## 📖 Overview  
This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm on the **MNIST dataset**, a well-known collection of **handwritten digit images**. The goal is to classify digits (0-9) by finding the most similar training examples using **distance-based voting**.  

## 🔹 Features  
- 📝 **MNIST Dataset**: 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.  
- 🧑‍💻 **KNN Algorithm**: Classifies digits by comparing distances to nearest neighbors.  
- 🛠️ **Implementation**: Built from scratch in Python, with optional libraries like **NumPy** and **scikit-learn**.  
- 📊 **Evaluation**: Measures accuracy and performance on the test set.  

## 🧠 How It Works  
1. **Load Data**: Preprocess the MNIST images and labels.  
2. **Choose k**: Select the number of nearest neighbors for classification.  
3. **Distance Calculation**: Compute distances (e.g., **Euclidean**) between test and training points.  
4. **Vote**: Neighbors “vote” for the most common label.  
5. **Predict**: Assign the most popular label to the test image.  

## 🚀 Results  
- **Accuracy**: Achieves strong classification performance on the MNIST test set.  
- **Flexibility**: Allows tuning of `k` and distance metrics for optimization.
