# 🧠 K-Nearest Neighbors on MNIST Dataset

## 📖 Overview
This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm on the **MNIST dataset** using **C++**. The MNIST dataset is a well-known collection of **handwritten digit images** (0-9). The goal of this project is to classify digits by identifying the most similar training examples through a **distance-based voting mechanism**.

## 🔹 Features
- 📝 **MNIST Dataset**: Consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
- 💻 **C++ Implementation**: Built from scratch with efficient data structures and algorithms.
- 🧠 **KNN Algorithm**: Classifies digits by measuring distances to the nearest neighbors.
- ⚡ **Performance**: Optimized for speed and memory usage in C++.
- 📊 **Evaluation**: Measures accuracy and performance on the test set.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Load Data**: Parse and preprocess the MNIST images and labels.
2. **Choose k**: Select the number of nearest neighbors for classification.
3. **Distance Calculation**: Compute distances (e.g., **Euclidean distance**) between test and training points.
4. **Vote**: Neighbors cast votes for their respective labels.
5. **Predict**: Assign the most common label to the test image based on the votes.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- **CMake** (Optional, for project building)
- **Libraries**: STL (Standard Template Library), optional libraries for matrix operations like Eigen or OpenCV (if needed)

## 🚀 Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieves strong classification performance on the MNIST test set.
- **Flexibility**: Allows tuning of `k` and distance metrics for optimization.
- **Efficiency**: Leverages C++ capabilities for fast computation and memory management.

## 📝 Usage
```bash
# Compile the program
g++ knn_mnist.cpp -o knn_mnist

# Run the program
./knn_mnist
```

## 🔍 Future Improvements
- 🧑‍🔬 Support for different distance metrics (Manhattan, Minkowski, etc.)
- 🚀 Parallelization for faster distance computation
- 🧠 Hyperparameter tuning for optimal `k`
- 📈 Visualizations of classification results
